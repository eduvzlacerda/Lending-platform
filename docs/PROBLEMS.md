# Problems:
- Access should be restricted in backend, not UI!
- remove console.log from UI!
- Add paging in UI as well!
- Do we really need article-detail-view for this simple app?
- Get registered user somehow in backend?
- id's in sample-data should be unique (even if they are in separate tables)
- people can lend their own articles
- lended articles should be hidden?
- hidden articles should be hidden
- without being logged in -> show error when one wants to borrow an article
- register form: confirm password
