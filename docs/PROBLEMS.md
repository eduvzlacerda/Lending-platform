# Problems and TODOs

# Problems:
- Access should be restricted in backend, not UI!
- remove console.log from UI!
- Add paging in UI as well!
- Do we really need article-detail-view for this simple app?
- Get registered user somehow in backend?
- id's in sample-data should be unique (even if they are in separate tables)
